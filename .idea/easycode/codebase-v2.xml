The template ties into the polls app URL patterns and view functions.\&quot;,\&quot;/polls/urls.py\&quot;:\&quot;This polls/urls.py file defines the URL patterns for the polls app in Django.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Imports path from django.urls to define URL patterns\\n- Imports views from . (the polls app views)\\n- Sets the app_name to \\\&quot;polls\\\&quot;\\n- Defines urlpatterns as a list of URL patterns\\n\\nThe URL patterns it defines:\\n\\n- \\\&quot;\\\&quot; - Maps to the IndexView to list all polls \\n- \\\&quot;\\u003cint:pk\\u003e/\\\&quot; - Maps to the DetailView to display a single poll\\n- \\\&quot;\\u003cint:pk\\u003e/results/\\\&quot; - Maps to the ResultsView to display results for a poll  \\n- \\\&quot;\\u003cint:question_id\\u003e/vote/\\\&quot; - Maps to the vote view function to handle voting\\n\\nSo in summary, it maps URLs to the relevant views for listing, displaying, viewing results and voting on polls. This allows Django to route incoming requests to the appropriate view functions based on the URL.\&quot;,\&quot;/plemiona/army_data.py\&quot;:\&quot;Based on the file name and path, this file likely contains data and functions related to armies in a game or simulation involving tribes/plemiona. Some key things it may contain:\\n\\n- Data structures defining different army unit types (infantry, cavalry, archers etc.), with attributes like health points, damage, speed etc. \\n\\n- Functions to generate random army compositions within certain parameters (e.g. generate an army of 10 units with at least 2 cavalry).\\n\\n- Classes defining Army objects that can own collections of unit types.\\n\\n- Methods on Army classes to perform actions like attack(), defend(), move() that call underlying unit type functions. \\n\\n- Static data like unit stats that are shared across all army instances.\\n\\n- Helper functions to calculate things like total army strength based on unit counts and stats. \\n\\n- Potentially load/save functions to read/write army data to files or a database.\\n\\n- Unit production functions if armies can train/recruit new units over time. \\n\\nSo in summary, it handles the data and logic related to generating, storing, and manipulating army units and compositions within the context of some tribe/civilization simulation or strategy game. The key functions would revolve around creating, modifying, and interacting with Army objects.\&quot;,\&quot;/plemiona/migrations/0002_village_user_alter_village_barracks_and_more.py\&quot;:\&quot;This Django migration file makes several changes to the Village model:\\n\\n1. It adds a ForeignKey field to the Village model called \\u0027user\\u0027 that links to the User model. This associates each village with a user.\\n\\n2. It alters several IntegerField fields on Village (barracks, coordinate_x, coordinate_y, halberdiers, pikemen, town_hall) to set default values for when new villages are created. \\n\\n3. It alters the CharField \\u0027village_name\\u0027 to set a default value of \\u0027New Village\\u0027.\\n\\n4. It adds a unique constraint so that the combination of coordinate_x and coordinate_y must be unique for each village, preventing duplicate coordinates. \\n\\nSo in summary, the key functions of this migration file are:\\n\\n- Add user association to Village model \\n- Set default values for integer fields on Village\\n- Set default name for villages\\n- Add unique constraint to coordinate fields\\n\\nThis migration makes changes to properly associate villages with users, set up default field values, and ensure coordinate uniqueness.\&quot;,\&quot;/plemiona/templates/plemiona/user_villages.html\&quot;:\&quot;This template file renders a user\\u0027s villages page in the Plemiona village building game.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Extends the base template at plemiona/base.html to inherit common elements\\n- Displays a heading \\\&quot;Twoje wioski\\\&quot; (Your villages)\\n- Checks if the user has any villages saved ({% if villages %})\\n- If so, displays a table with village details:\\n  - Village name, coordinates, building counts, resource amounts\\n- Loops through each village object in the villages context variable\\n- Displays the village data values \\n- Includes a link to view the village detail page\\n- If no villages, displays a message \\\&quot;Nie masz jeszcze żadnych wiosek.\\\&quot;\\n- Renders the village data in a readable table format\\n\\nIn summary, it displays a list of the logged in user\\u0027s saved villages including their attributes. It provides a link to view each village in more detail. The template handles displaying the villages or a no villages message.\&quot;,\&quot;/polls/templates/polls/index.html\&quot;:\&quot;This template file (index.html) is used to display a list of polls for the polls app in Django.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- It checks if there are any polls available in the latest_question_list context variable passed to the template.\\n\\n- If there are polls, it loops through each question in latest_question_list and displays the question text as a link to the detail view for that question. This link uses the url template tag to generate the URL for the polls:detail view, passing the question ID.\\n\\n- If there are no polls, it displays a message \\\&quot;No polls are available.\\\&quot;\\n\\n- So in summary, it displays an unordered list (\\u003cul\\u003e) of all available polls by looping through the question list and outputting the question text as links. Or it shows a no polls available message if the question list is empty.\\n\\n- This allows listing all available polls on the polls index/home page in an easy to read format for the user.\\n\\nSo in essence, it displays a listing of available polls to the user from the context data provided to the template.\&quot;,\&quot;/polls/__init__.py\&quot;:\&quot;The __init__.py file in a Python package is used to initialize that package. Some key things about __init__.py:\\n\\n- It tells Python that the directory it is in should be treated as a package. Without an __init__.py file, Python will not treat the directory as containing packages or modules.\\n\\n- It can contain import statements that will be run automatically when the package is imported. This allows submodules and other code to be imported automatically.\\n\\n- It can define package-level variables, functions, classes that will be available when importing any part of the package.\\n\\n- It is often empty, just containing pass or import statements. But it can contain initialization code for the package.\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- Tells Python the directory is a package \\n- Can contain import statements to import submodules automatically\\n- Can define package-level objects available throughout the package\\n- Initializes the package when it is imported\\n\\nSome common things defined in __init__.py include:\\n\\n- Package-level variables\\n- Common utility functions \\n- Imports of commonly used submodules\\n- Exception and class definitions used throughout the package\\n\\nSo in this case, polls/__init__.py would initialize the polls package and make any objects defined in it available whenever any part of the polls package is imported.\&quot;,\&quot;/polls/templates/polls/results.html\&quot;:\&quot;This template file displays the results of a poll question.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Displays the text of the poll question using {{ question.question_text }}\\n\\n- Loops through each Choice in the question\\u0027s choice_set using {% for %} and displays:\\n\\n  - The text of the choice \\n  - The number of votes for that choice\\n  - Pluralizes the word \\\&quot;vote\\\&quot; correctly based on the number\\n\\n- Generates a link back to the poll detail view to allow voting again using the {% url %} template tag.\\n\\nIn summary, it displays the results of a poll question by listing each choice and the number of votes for that choice. It also provides a link to vote again on that question. This allows viewing the results after voting is complete.\&quot;,\&quot;/plemiona/templates/plemiona/register.html\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a template for user registration in Django.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- It extends the base template using the {% block content %} tag. This allows content to be inserted into a common layout.\\n\\n- It displays a registration form using the Django form object passed to the template. {{ form.as_p }} renders the form fields as paragraph tags.\\n\\n- The form\\u0027s action is set to POST to the same URL using the default method\\u003d\\\&quot;post\\\&quot;. \\n\\n- It includes a CSRF token for security using {% csrf_token %}\\n\\n- When submitted, the form will send the user input as POST data to be processed by the register view function. \\n\\n- A submit button labeled \\\&quot;Register\\\&quot; is included to allow submitting the form.\\n\\n- It provides a simple and common interface for registering a new user account without needing to define the form fields directly in the template. The form object is rendered automatically.\\n\\nSo in summary, it displays a registration form template to collect and submit user data to the register view for processing a new user account. The template handles common form display and submission functionality.\&quot;,\&quot;/plemiona/buildings_data.py\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines building data for a tribe/civilization simulation game.\\n\\nKey points:\\n\\n- It defines a buildings dictionary with keys for different building types (sawmill, clay pit, iron mine, town hall)\\n\\n- Each building type contains a list of level data dictionaries\\n\\n- The level data dictionaries define stats for each building level like materials required, population needed/supported, production output, and for town hall also build time\\n\\n- Stats increase with each higher building level \\n\\n- Building levels provide progression as the tribe/civilization advances\\n\\n- Materials, population and production stats allow simulation of gathering resources, population growth, and output over time\\n\\n- Build time for town hall allows simulating construction process\\n\\nSo in summary, this file defines the core building data that drives the simulation mechanics for gathering resources, population capacity and production as buildings are constructed and leveled up in the game. It provides the underlying data model for simulating the advancement and growth of the tribe/civilization over time.\&quot;,\&quot;/plemiona/tests.py\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a test case file for Django tests.\\n\\nKey things about it:\\n\\n- The file name (tests.py) indicates it contains test cases. This is a common naming convention for Django test files.\\n\\n- It imports TestCase from django.test. TestCase is the base class for defining and running tests in Django.\\n\\n- No tests are defined yet. The comment \\\&quot;# Create your tests here\\\&quot; indicates this is where tests would be written. \\n\\n- To write tests, classes would be defined that inherit from TestCase. These test classes would contain method names beginning with \\\&quot;test_\\\&quot; that contain the test logic.\\n\\n- Common testing functions that could be used include:\\n  - assertEqual() - check two values are equal\\n  - assertNotEqual() - check two values are not equal \\n  - assertTrue() - check a condition is true\\n  - assertFalse() - check a condition is false\\n  - etc.\\n\\n- Running this file (e.g. via manage.py test) would execute any test methods defined to validate the code works as expected.\\n\\nSo in summary, this file provides the scaffolding for defining Django tests, but no tests have been implemented yet based on the comment. The TestCase base class and common assert functions would be used to write the actual test logic.\&quot;,\&quot;/plemiona/signals.py\&quot;:\&quot;This signals.py file connects a Django signal to a receiver function.\\n\\nIt does the following:\\n\\n1. Imports the post_save signal from Django\\u0027s model signals.\\n\\n2. Imports the receiver decorator to register the receiver function. \\n\\n3. Imports the AUTH_USER_MODEL setting to get the User model.\\n\\n4. Defines a receiver function for the post_save signal of the User model. \\n\\n5. The receiver function checks if the User instance was just created (created\\u003dTrue).\\n\\n6. If created, it creates a new Village object associated to the new User instance.\\n\\nSo in summary, it automatically creates a Village object each time a new User is created, linking the Village to that User.\\n\\nThe key functions are:\\n\\n- @receiver - Decorates the function to register it as a receiver\\n- create_village_for_new_user - The receiver function that handles the post_save signal\\n\\nThis allows new Villages to be automatically created whenever a new user signs up, linking their account to a Village.\&quot;,\&quot;/polls/admin.py\&quot;:\&quot;This file configures the admin interface for the polls app in Django.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Imports the Question model from the .models module\\n\\n- Defines a QuestionAdmin class that inherits from ModelAdmin. This customizes how the Question model will appear in the admin.\\n\\n- Sets the fields attribute on QuestionAdmin to specify which fields from the Question model should be editable in the admin - in this case just pub_date and question_text.\\n\\n- Registers the Question model with the Django admin site using admin.site.register(), passing in Question and QuestionAdmin. \\n\\nThis allows the Question model to appear in the Django admin interface, with its fields and display customized by the QuestionAdmin class. Admin users can then add, edit, delete Question objects from the admin interface.\\n\\nSo in summary, it:\\n\\n- Configures the Question model for use in the Django admin\\n- Customizes its display and editable fields \\n- Registers it with the admin site\&quot;,\&quot;/polls/migrations/__init__.py\&quot;:\&quot;The __init__.py file in a Python package is used to mark the directory as a Python package so it can be imported. Some key things about __init__.py:\\n\\n- It allows the directory it resides in to be considered a Python package, so it can be imported.\\n\\n- It does not need to contain anything - it can be empty. But it is commonly used to export/import things from the package.\\n\\n- Any import of the package will execute the code in __init__.py first. So it\\u0027s a common place to put initialization code.\\n\\n- It can import modules/functions from other files within the package and re-export them, to provide a single entry point to the package.\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- Marks the directory as a Python package \\n- Can contain initialization/import code that runs on import\\n- Can import and re-export modules within the package\\n- Provides a single entry point for importing the whole package\\n\\nThe __init__.py file in the polls/migrations directory in Django would allow the migrations directory to be considered a package. It likely doesn\\u0027t contain any code itself, but enables importing modules from within migrations as part of the polls app.\&quot;,\&quot;/plemiona/admin.py\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines the admin interface for the Village model from the plemiona app.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Imports the Village model from the plemiona.models module\\n\\n- Defines a QuestionAdmin class that inherits from admin.ModelAdmin\\n\\n- Sets the fields attribute on QuestionAdmin to define which model fields should be editable in the admin\\n\\n- Registers the Village model with the Django admin site using admin.site.register(), passing Village and QuestionAdmin \\n\\nThis allows the Village model to be managed via the Django admin interface. The QuestionAdmin class customizes which fields are shown/editable for the Village model in the admin.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- admin.site.register() - Registers the Village model with the admin site\\n- QuestionAdmin - Customizes the admin interface for the Village model\\n- fields attribute - Defines which model fields are editable in the admin\\n\\nSo in summary, it configures the admin interface for managing Village model instances via the Django admin backend.\&quot;,\&quot;/plemiona/tasks.py\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains Celery tasks for updating village resources in the background.\\n\\nThe key things it does:\\n\\n- Defines an update_resources task that will be run asynchronously by Celery.\\n\\n- The update_resources task queries all Village model instances from the database. \\n\\n- It loops through each village and calls get_performance to calculate the resource increase amounts based on each building\\u0027s level.\\n\\n- It updates the village\\u0027s wood, clay, and iron attributes by the increase amounts and saves the village back to the database.\\n\\n- The get_performance function takes the building level, type, and resource data to lookup and return the appropriate performance increase amount based on the building specs.\\n\\nThe main functions are:\\n\\n- update_resources - The Celery task that queries villages and updates their resources\\n- get_performance - Helper function to lookup a building\\u0027s performance increase amount\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides asynchronous background tasks to periodically update village resources based on building levels using Celery.\&quot;,\&quot;/plemiona/templates/plemiona/village_detail.html\&quot;:\&quot;This template file renders the village detail view in the plemiona Django app.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Displays the village name, coordinates and owner name\\n- Conditionally displays full village details (buildings, resources, units) if the logged in user owns the village\\n- Links to the town hall view \\n- Links back to a list of all villages view\\n- Renders basic village info if not the owner, allowing limited visibility\\n\\nSo in summary, it:\\n\\n- Displays village details\\n- Handles owner vs non-owner views differently \\n- Links to related views\\n- Uses Django template tags like url, if/else blocks\\n\\nThe purpose is to show the details of a single village, including full or limited info depending on ownership, and provide navigation within the village/map app.\&quot;,\&quot;/plemiona/templates/plemiona/town_hall.html\&quot;:\&quot;This HTML template is for the town hall view in a village management game.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Displays links to view all villages and return to the village detail page\\n- Displays the name, coordinates, and resources of the current village \\n- Loops through the next upgrade levels for each building type\\n  - Displays the current level of the building\\n  - Displays the resource requirements for the next level\\n  - Checks if the player is missing any required resources\\n  - Displays an upgrade link if requirements are met\\n\\nIn summary, it displays information about the current village and allows the player to view upgrade requirements and initiate upgrades for different building types from the town hall. The template uses Django template tags and filters to dynamically display village data and links.\&quot;,\&quot;/plemiona/templatetags/__init__.py\&quot;:\&quot;This file is for a Django template tags module. Some key things about it:\\n\\n- Location: The path indicates it is a template tags module inside an app called \\\&quot;plemiona\\\&quot;.\\n\\n- Purpose: Template tags modules allow custom tags, filters and other functionality to be added to Django templates.\\n\\n- __init__.py: This empty file tells Python that this directory is a Python package, even though it doesn\\u0027t contain any code itself. This allows other code to import things from this directory.\\n\\n- No functions: As an __init__.py file, it doesn\\u0027t contain any code or functions itself. It just marks the directory as a Python package.\\n\\n- Contains tags: The actual template tags, filters, etc would be defined in other Python files inside this directory. Those files could then be imported and used in templates.\\n\\nSo in summary, this __init__.py file:\\n\\n- Marks the plemiona/templatetags directory as a Python package \\n- Allows other code to import things from this directory\\n- Doesn\\u0027t contain any code itself - tags are defined in other files in this directory\\n- Used to organize Django template tags for the \\\&quot;plemiona\\\&quot; app\&quot;,\&quot;/plemiona/templatetags/custom_filters.py\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a custom template filter for Django templates.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It imports the template library from Django\\n- It registers a template.Library object called register \\n- It defines a filter called get_attribute using the register.filter decorator\\n- get_attribute takes a value and arg and uses getattr to dynamically get an attribute on the value by the name in arg\\n- This allows templates to access object attributes dynamically by name like {{ obj|get_attribute:\\\&quot;field\\\&quot; }}\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- It defines a custom template filter \\n- The filter is called get_attribute\\n- get_attribute uses getattr to dynamically get an attribute by name\\n- This allows templates to access attributes by a variable name rather than hardcoding the attribute name\\n\\nThe key functions are:\\n\\n- register.filter - Defines a custom filter\\n- get_attribute - The filter function itself which uses getattr\\n\\nSo it provides a way to dynamically access object attributes in templates via a custom filter.\&quot;,\&quot;/polls/tests.py\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains tests for the polls app in Django.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Defines test classes that inherit from Django\\u0027s TestCase class\\n- Tests model methods on the Question model\\n  - Tests was_published_recently() with future, old and recent questions\\n- Defines a helper function create_question() to easily create Question objects for tests\\n- Tests the polls:index view\\n  - Checks different contexts with no questions, past questions, future questions\\n- Tests the polls:detail view\\n  - Checks 404 for future questions, displays text for past questions\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- test_was_published_recently_with_future_question()\\n- test_was_published_recently_with_old_question() \\n- test_was_published_recently_with_recent_question()\\n- create_question()\\n- test_no_questions()\\n- test_past_question()\\n- test_future_question()\\n- test_future_question_and_past_question()  \\n- test_two_past_questions()\\n- test_future_question()\\n- test_past_question()\\n\\nIn summary, it defines model and view tests for the polls app to ensure proper behavior and output for different question scenarios.\&quot;,\&quot;/djangoProject1/__init__.py\&quot;:\&quot;This __init__.py file in the djangoProject1 app directory is used to configure Celery tasks for the Django project.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Imports the celery app instance from djangoProject1/celery.py. This is where Celery is configured for this project.\\n\\n- Defines celery_app as a global variable that can be imported from this app. \\n\\n- Includes celery_app in the __all__ tuple. This exposes celery_app when this app is imported as a package.\\n\\nThe main purpose is to ensure the Celery app is always loaded when Django starts up. This allows:\\n\\n- Tasks to be defined and registered with Celery in other files in this app.\\n\\n- Other parts of the project to import and use celery_app to interact with Celery, such as calling tasks.\\n\\n- Django signals and receivers to define tasks using the shared celery_app instance.\\n\\nSo in summary, it configures Celery integration for the project by importing and exposing the Celery app defined in celery.py. This allows tasks to be defined and called throughout the Django project codebase.\&quot;,\&quot;/plemiona/apps.py\&quot;:\&quot;This file configures the Django app called \\\&quot;plemiona\\\&quot;.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Defines a class called PlemionaConfig that inherits from AppConfig\\n- Sets the default auto field to BigAutoField for the models\\n- Sets the name attribute to \\u0027plemiona\\u0027, which is the name of the app\\n- Defines a ready() method\\n- In ready(), it imports the signals file from the plemiona app\\n\\nThe main functions are:\\n\\n1. Configures the app by defining a config class\\n2. Sets the default auto field for models \\n3. Sets the name of the app\\n4. Imports signals when the app is ready to ensure signals are connected\\n\\nSo in summary, it configures the Django app called \\\&quot;plemiona\\\&quot;, sets some defaults, and imports signals to connect them when the app is loaded. The ready() method ensures certain code runs when the app is initialized.\&quot;,\&quot;/polls/models.py\&quot;:\&quot;This polls/models.py file defines the models (database tables) for a basic polls app in Django.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Defines a Question model with fields for the question text and publication date.\\n\\n- Defines a Choice model with a foreign key to Question, fields for the choice text and votes. \\n\\n- Includes model methods:\\n  - __str__ defines how objects are displayed when printed\\n  - was_published_recently checks if a question was published within the last day\\n\\n- The models will be used to represent polls questions and choices in the database. Django\\u0027s ORM allows interacting with and querying these models.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- was_published_recently - Checks if a question was published within the last day\\n- __str__ - Defines the string representation of model instances when printed\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the database schema/models for polls questions and choices that can then be used throughout the Django application.\&quot;,\&quot;/plemiona/models.py\&quot;:\&quot;This models.py file defines models for a village building game:\\n\\n- The Village model represents a player\\u0027s village. It has fields for village name, location coordinates, buildings levels, resources amounts, etc.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- save() method overrides the default to handle potential integrity errors from duplicate coordinates. It randomly generates new coords and retries the save if an error occurs.\\n\\n- Meta class defines the village coordinates as a unique_together constraint to prevent duplicate village locations from being saved. \\n\\n- __str__() method defines how Village objects will be represented as strings.\\n\\n- Default field values set initial levels/amounts for new villages.\\n\\nSo in summary, this defines the main Village model/object for the game with all its attributes. The overridden save() handles duplicate coordinate errors, and the unique_together ensures no two villages can occupy the same space on the game map.\&quot;,\&quot;/manage.py\&quot;:\&quot;The manage.py file is the main entry point for administrative tasks and commands in a Django project.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Sets the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable to tell Django which settings.py file to use. This allows Django to find the project configuration.\\n\\n- Tries to import the execute_from_command_line function from django.core.management. This function allows executing Django management commands.\\n\\n- Calls execute_from_command_line, passing in the sys.argv list of arguments. This runs the requested management command.\\n\\n- Handles import errors if Django is not installed/available.\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- Sets up the Django environment \\n- Imports the command execution function\\n- Runs the requested management command passed via the command line\\n- Handles import errors gracefully\\n\\nThe main functions are:\\n\\n- Setting DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE \\n- Importing execute_from_command_line\\n- Calling execute_from_command_line to run commands\\n- Error handling for import issues\\n\\nIt acts as the main entry point for all Django administrative tasks and commands.\&quot;,\&quot;/plemiona/migrations/__init__.py\&quot;:\&quot;This file is located in the migrations directory of a Django project. It is used to manage database migrations.\\n\\nSome key things about this file:\\n\\n- It initializes the migrations module for the app. Django will look here for migration files.\\n\\n- No code is actually defined in this file. It simply tells Django that this directory contains migrations for the app.\\n\\n- Migration files are Python files that define how to migrate the database schema from one version to another. They contain the operations to alter the schema.\\n\\n- Django uses this directory to track the applied/unapplied migrations via a migrations table in the database.\\n\\n- Common functions include:\\n\\n  - makemigrations - Generates new migration files based on changes to models.\\n\\n  - migrate - Applies or unapplies migrations to bring the schema to a specific state.\\n\\n  - showmigrations - Shows a list of all migrations and if they have been applied.\\n\\nSo in summary, this empty __init__.py file tells Django this directory contains the migrations for the app. Django then uses it to manage and track database migrations for that app.\&quot;,\&quot;/plemiona/templates/plemiona/login.html\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a template for the login page in Django.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Renders a login form using the Django form handling.\\n\\n- Includes the {% csrf_token %} tag which adds CSRF protection for the form.\\n\\n- Displays the form fields using {{ form.as_p }} which renders each field in a \\u003cp\\u003e tag. \\n\\n- Defines a block called \\\&quot;content\\\&quot; that the login content will be rendered inside of. This allows other templates to extend this one and add content around the login form.\\n\\n- Specifies the form submission method as POST.\\n\\n- Includes a submit button to send the form data.\\n\\nIn summary:\\n\\n- Defines the template for the login page\\n- Renders the login form \\n- Adds CSRF protection\\n- Displays form fields neatly\\n- Allows extending/wrapping the content\\n- Submits form data on button click\\n\\nSo in essence it handles displaying and processing the login form submission within the Django template system.\&quot;,\&quot;/plemiona/__init__.py\&quot;:\&quot;This __init__.py file is indicating that plemiona is a Python package. Some key things about __init__.py files:\\n\\n- They tell Python that the directory they are in should be treated as a package. This allows submodules and packages to be imported as part of that package.\\n\\n- They can import submodules/packages that are part of the package to make them available at the package level. \\n\\n- They can define package-level constants, variables, functions or classes that will be available throughout the package.\\n\\n- They allow relative imports between submodules within the same package.\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- Tells Python plemiona is a package \\n- Can import/export submodules/packages within plemiona to make them available at the package level\\n- Can define package-level objects available throughout plemiona\\n- Enables relative imports between submodules within plemiona\\n\\nBut without seeing the contents of this specific __init__.py file, it\\u0027s not possible to list out its exact key functions. The file could be empty, or it could import/export things to define the package\\u0027s public API.\&quot;,\&quot;/plemiona/templatetags/village_tags.py\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines custom template tags for working with villages in Django templates.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Imports the Village model from the plemiona app models.\\n\\n- Registers a template tag library called \\\&quot;village_tags\\\&quot;\\n\\n- Defines a simple_tag called \\\&quot;get_active_village\\\&quot;\\n\\n- The get_active_village tag function:\\n\\n  - Gets the active village ID from the request session\\n\\n  - Filters the Village model to get the object matching that ID\\n\\n  - Returns the village object or None if no ID in session\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- Defines a template tag library\\n- Registers it for use in templates \\n- Defines a tag to retrieve the active/selected village object from the request session\\n- This allows templates to access the currently selected village without passing it directly\\n\\nThe main purpose is to provide a template tag that templates can use to access the currently selected village in a cleaner way than passing the object directly.\&quot;,\&quot;/polls/apps.py\&quot;:\&quot;This polls/apps.py file in a Django project configures the polls application.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Defines a PollsConfig class that inherits from AppConfig\\n- Sets the name attribute on PollsConfig to \\u0027polls\\u0027, which is the name of the application\\n- Sets the default_auto_field attribute to specify the default primary key field type for models defined in this app (in this case a BigAutoField)\\n\\nBy inheriting from AppConfig, this allows Django to:\\n\\n- Identify this Python package as a Django application \\n- Load any signals, receivers or other app-specific configurations\\n- Include this app in the INSTALLED_APPS setting\\n- Automatically register models defined in models.py with the Django admin\\n\\nSo in summary, it:\\n\\n- Configures the polls app \\n- Identifies it as a Django application\\n- Sets default model fields\\n- Allows Django to auto-discover and load components of this app\\n\\nThis is a standard file that Django expects to find for each application to properly configure and integrate it.\&quot;,\&quot;/polls/views.py\&quot;:\&quot;This polls/views.py file contains the views for the polls app in Django.\\n\\nThe key functions are:\\n\\n- IndexView: A class-based view that displays the 5 most recent published questions. It uses the generic ListView.\\n\\n- DetailView: A class-based view that displays the detail of a single question. It uses the generic DetailView. \\n\\n- ResultsView: A class-based view that displays the results of a question. It uses the generic DetailView.\\n\\n- vote: A function-based view that handles voting on a question. It increments the votes for the selected choice and redirects to the results page.\\n\\nSome other notable things:\\n\\n- It uses generic class-based views like ListView and DetailView to handle common view logic.\\n\\n- The get_queryset methods filter questions to only include published ones. \\n\\n- vote handles form submission, validates choice selection, increments votes, and redirects to prevent duplicate form submissions.\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides the main views - index, detail, results - to display poll data, as well as a view to handle voting, using Django\\u0027s class-based views where applicable.\&quot;,\&quot;/plemiona/templates/plemiona/base.html\&quot;:\&quot;This file is the base template that all other templates in the application will extend. It provides common elements that will be shared across all pages, including:\\n\\n- Header: Common header content is included here.\\n\\n- Active Village Display: If there is an active village ID stored in the session, it will retrieve the village object from the database and display its details in a table. This uses the get_active_village tag from the village_tags template library.\\n\\n- Content Block: The {% block content %} tags define a block that child templates can override to insert their own specific content. \\n\\n- Footer: Common footer content is included here.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Defines common layout elements like header and footer to be inherited by all pages\\n- Checks for active village in session and displays its data \\n- Defines a content block that child templates can override\\n- Loads common CSS and template tags/filters\\n- Provides structure and consistency across all templates\\n\\nSo in summary, it establishes a base template structure and includes common elements, while child templates extend it to add their unique content within the defined block. This avoids duplicating header/footer code on every page.\&quot;,\&quot;/plemiona/views.py\&quot;:\&quot;This views.py file contains functions that handle requests and return responses for a village/tribe management game.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- UserLoginView: Custom login view that redirects to the \\u0027plemiona\\u0027 namespace after login.\\n\\n- admin_create_village: View for admins to create a new village for a user. \\n\\n- get_user_village: Gets the villages belonging to the logged in user.
